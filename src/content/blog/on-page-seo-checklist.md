# The Complete On-Page SEO Checklist for 2024

On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages to rank higher in search engines and earn more relevant traffic. Unlike off-page SEO, which focuses on external signals like backlinks, on-page SEO is entirely within your control.

This comprehensive checklist covers everything you need to optimize your pages for maximum search engine visibility.
